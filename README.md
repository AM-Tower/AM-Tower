This is an End of Time simulator based on 42 [AM-Towers](https://am-tower.com/) built around the world. 

This is a Simulation Game, that is based on the way you set up your society in this Role-Playing Game or RPG.

This is a Game, and a Simulation, much like Microsoft Flight Simulator, is also a Game, and this Game will create a Flight Simulator Add-on. 

I will make videos during the gameplay and will post them on my AM-Tower [YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/@AM-Tower).

You will find more information on my Wiki, things like [Duplicating a UE5 Plugin](https://github.com/AM-Tower/Lyra-Base/wiki/Duplicating-a-UE5-Plugin).

I am a medically retired United States Air Force Staff Sergeant who knows about the End of Time.
